# uwu-android
A simple uwu translator for Android.

## why?
Remember the [C++ version of this](https://github.com/mackyclemen/uwu-cpp)? Now it's on Android! (yay!)

## any features?
The translator:
- converts the letters 'l' and 'r' to the letter 'w';
- converts any words that have 'mo' and 'no' to 'myo-' and 'nyo-';
- converts any words that have 'hu' to 'hoo' (such as human -> hooman);
- and the the cherry on top: the 'uwu' at the end.
